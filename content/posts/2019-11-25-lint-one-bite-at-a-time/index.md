Linters like ESLint or TSLint can help make your code more readable and maintainable and help you to identify errors earlier. It's a good thing to use linters from the start of a project but it's also a good idea to introduce linters in an existing codebases.

This article focuses on introducing linters in existing codebases.

# The problem

Let's say the codebase is 1000 files large. You create a linter config, run the linter and you get like 1000000 errors. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜±

Now what can you do?

**Autofix**

A lot of linting rule can be autofixed. For example the tslint rule

```
"no-var-keyword": true
```

can be autofixed. The autofixer replaces the _var_ keyword with a _let_ keyword.

Tip: All autofixable keywords in the [list](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/) have the "Has Fixer" tag.

**Manually fix**

If you can't auto fix it, you have to manually fix it. That can be a "herculean task". So what often happens is that a rule is just not used because it's to much work to fix all the existing errors.

# The solution: The Boy Scout Rule

> Leave your code better than you found it. ...

## Different Rules for CI/CD and local development

The best way to apply new rules is:

- Fix existing errors when you touch existing code
- Don't add new errors

This can be achieved by having to sets of rules:

**tslint.json**

Used by the CI/CD pipeline.

```json
{
  "defaultSeverity": "error",
  "rules": {
    "no-empty": true
  }
}
```

**tslint.newrules.json**

Used during the precommit hook.

```json
{
  "defaultSeverity": "error",
  "extends": ["./tslint.json"],
  "rules": {
    "no-any": true
  }
}
```

Important: The tslint.newrules.json extends the main ruleset.

```json
{
  "extends": ["./tslint.json"]
}
```

## Enforce tslint.newrules.json with a precommit hook

That part is very easy nowadays thanks to the amazing libraries [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

So just install lint-staged and then configure the precommit hook to run tslint or eslint with the the correct configuration:

```
npm install --save-dev lint-staged@beta
```

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "**/*.{ts}": ["tslint --project tsconfig.json -c tslint.newrules.json"]
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  }
}
```

# Summary

It's very easy and very little work to set up a "newrule" config and enforce the config with a precommit hook. Now your codebase should become better every day as people are working on it. Without the upfront costs you'd have with fixing all errors in one commit.
